# so_long project

more details will be here soon.

Assets courtesy of [pixel-boy](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack) and [KMH Studios](https://kevins-moms-house.itch.io/fantasy).

Note: Took quite some time to convert files onto xpm for better quality control.
Used imagemagick and a python script for converting them into xpm files onto usage in the game here.
